Harmonify
## Introduction
Harmonify is a web application that curates personalized music recommendations using Spotify's API. Users can input their favorite tracks, and Harmonify will generate a list of recommended songs based on their preferences. This project was developed as a part of my portfolio project for Holberton School.
